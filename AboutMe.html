		<h1> About me! </h1>
		<p> My name is Jackson, I am in 8th grade and I enjoy computers. I live in minnesota and my parents got divorced when I was in 5th grade. I got introduced to coding in the beginning of 7th grade with an app called "Hopscotch" at first I was a bit confused but I picked it up quickly. After a few months of using the app and I got one of my projects featured.</p>
