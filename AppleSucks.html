			Apple Sucks
		</h1>
		
		<p>
			Ok The Title is probably an exaduration but to be honest, when I got my first phone I wanted an iPhone but my mom didnt want me to have an expensive phone as my first phone so she got me a cheap $60 android, and I loved it!  
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I wanted an iPhone because all my friends had one supporting the iSheep stereotype (everyone has an iPhone and i want an iPhone) and if you have an iPhone, why did you get it? Did you do any research on other phones before buying it?
		</p>

		<p>
			If you think about it there is'nt a single thing that an iPhone has that androids do not, besides a few apps on the app store.
