			To be honest, when I got my first phone I wanted an iPhone but my mom didnt want me to have an expensive phone as my first phone so she got me a cheap $60 android, and I loved it!

			I wanted an iPhone because all my friends had one supporting the iSheep stereotype (everyone has an iPhone and I want an iPhone) and I was one and if you have an iPhone, why did you get it? Did you do any research on other phones before buying it?

			If you think about it there is'nt a single thing that an iPhone has that androids do not, besides maybe a few apps on the app store and if its not on Google Play there are ways to download that app off the internet. Many people may say iPhones have siri, androids have Google assistant ("Ok Google") or iTunes but androids have "Google play music" and "play movies". Androids also have many features that ios has like swipe typeing (kinda like cursive for a keyboard, drag your finger around to different leters to type) Patterns as a password, and widgets.
